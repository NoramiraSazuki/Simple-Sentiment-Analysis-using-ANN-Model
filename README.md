# Simple Sentiment Analysis using ANN Model.
This notebook is a starter for me in exploratory data analysis on the sentiment analysis. 
There is a collection of customer reviews originating from diverse 
sources, including social media, review platforms, testimonials, and others.

It comprises a collection of textual data, sentiment labels indicating positivity or 
negativity, the source of each sentiment, date/time of expression, user ID, location information, 
and a corresponding confidence score.

In this project I am using pandas, numpy and ANN deep learning model to predict sentiment of the text reviews.
